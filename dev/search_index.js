    "text": "This package provides MATLAB\'s inpaint_nans function originally written by John d\'Errico (and available on the MathWorks File Exchange website).inpaint_nans takes a vector or a matrix as input and fills the NaNs by solving a simple 1d or 2d PDE with a finite difference approximation of a Laplacian operator.So far Inpaintings.jl only replicates John d\'Errico\'s method 0 well, which is well suited for filling NaNs in a \"diffusive\" way. Methods 1 and 3 are on their way."
